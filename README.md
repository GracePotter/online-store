# Personal Details Management System

This project is a CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) application for managing user personal details in a relational database. 
It includes both a back-end and a front-end component:

1. **Back-End**: A Node.js application demonstrating CRUD operations using a MySQL database.
2. **Front-End**: A simple HTML/CSS/JS interface using AJAX to interact with the back-end.
